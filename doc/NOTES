(me!) AWS ELB for FTP guide: (docs/howto/AWS.html)
  When to (and not to!):
    don't care which client goes to which instance -- implies shared filesystem!
    if not, use RoundRobin Route53 config!
      Route 53 instance health checks!

    NOTE: IFF your instance is in a VPC (most common), then it may have a
      private IP address (RFC1918), which means it cannot be reached from
      outside.  For such cases, you WILL need an ELB to be the publicly
      reachable IP address, and let it contact your instance.  Not a bad
      arrangement from a network security perspective.  (Think SSH access
      to instance, but ONLY from mgmt LAN; SG or ELB enforced?)

  Elastic IP or no?
    Not if the instance is an internal VPC instance!

  TCP
  NO SSL (and why)
  full range of port mapping
  Health checks (TCP)
    * and how this can be used for "full servers" (mod_diskuse), "busy
      servers" (mod_load), etc.

  Security Group rules (NOT INBOUND PORT 20!!)
  VPC
    Network ACLs for inbound, outbound
  Debugging
    Logins succeed, but transfers fail
      MasqueradeAddress, PassivePorts, SGs, NACLs

  * MasqueradeAddress for ELB setup for DNS RoundRobin (use ELB DNS as
    masq addr or not, and why)

  * Limit on number of listeners on ELB?  Limit on number of rules in SG?
    (Think standard/default PassivePorts range, and one SG rule/ELB listener
    per port.)

    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-listener-config.html

    Interestingly, if you are using a VPC, then your ELB can have listeners
    on any ports (necessary for FTP).  If you are using Classic, then you
    CANNOT use an ELB for FTP, at least if you NEED FTP to listen on port 21
    on the ELB.  If you map the port to e.g. 2121, then you can.

    PROXY protocol, mod_proxy_protocol

  * ELB idle connection timeouts!

    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/config-idle-timeout.html

    Point out the KeepAlive doc, setting connection timeouts high!  Can
    idle timeouts be disabled?  Or configured incredibly long (24 hours?)

  * SGs (Class vs VPC)

    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-ec2-sg.html#configuring-a-security-group

    $ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id SG --protocol tcp --port PASV_MIN_PORT-PASV_MAX_PORT --cidr 0.0.0.0

  health.c
    Basic HTTP server, just to handle HTTP request to "/ping"/"/healthy"
    (configurable), for Route53/ELB healthchecks.  This lets mod_aws consult
    load/disk before returning 200 or not.

    Make sure to NOT listen on the public IP address! (or not?)  Default will
    listen on port 8080 of private IP address.

    Always include "Connection: close\r\n" response header!
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
    "Content-Length: 0\r\n"
    "Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store\r\n"

  Create a "struct aws_inst" that contains all of this info.  ONLY do this
  discovery on 'core.startup', NOT on 'core.postparse', as we do NOT need to
  do this after a restart, only on startup.

 Answer these questions:
   What region am I in?
   What AZ am I in?
   What instance type am I?
   What AMI am I running?
   What IAM role do I have?  What resources can I access/change?
   Am I in a VPC?
   Am I publicly reachable directly?
   Can I be reached for my vhost control ports?
   Can I be reached for my PassivePorts?  (FTP only)

 CAN these questions be answered without outside config?
   What ELBs am I in?

 Make all of the discovered instance metadata available for logging via
 notes: %{note:aws.instance-id}, etc.

 Options:
    Enable/disable ping/health listener
    Auto-adjust SGs for ingress (and egress, for active transfers)?
    Auto-configure MasqueradeAddress, PassivePorts
    Auto-register/deregister with ELBs (which ones?)
    Auto-register/deregister with Route53 (which names?)

  Add "test" ftp client connect, to public IP, to see if can read own
  banner?
